# Security Audit Report

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot  
**Repository:** jeremy0x/personal-website

## Executive Summary

A security audit was conducted on the codebase using `pnpm audit`. Two security vulnerabilities were identified and successfully fixed by updating dependencies and using package overrides.

## Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

### 1. @babel/runtime - CVE-2025-27789 (Moderate Severity)

**CVSS Score:** 6.2  
**Severity:** Moderate  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Babel has inefficient RegExp complexity in generated code with `.replace` when transpiling named capturing groups. This vulnerability could lead to performance issues when using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups.

**Affected Version:** 7.23.5  
**Fixed Version:** ≥7.26.10  
**Resolution:** Updated `eslint-config-next` from 13.4.12 to 15.5.6, which brought in the fixed version of @babel/runtime.

### 2. brace-expansion - CVE-2025-5889 (Low Severity)

**CVSS Score:** 3.1  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `expand` function. The manipulation leads to inefficient regular expression complexity that could be exploited remotely.

**Affected Version:** 1.1.11  
**Fixed Version:** ≥1.1.12  
**Resolution:** Added pnpm override to force brace-expansion to version ≥1.1.12 across all transitive dependencies.

## Changes Made

### Package Updates

1. **eslint:** 8.46.0 → 9.38.0
2. **eslint-config-next:** 13.4.12 → 15.5.6

### Package Overrides

Added pnpm overrides to `package.json`:
```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "brace-expansion": ">=1.1.12"
  }
}
```

## Verification

- ✅ Security audit (`pnpm audit`): No known vulnerabilities found
- ✅ Linting (`pnpm lint`): No ESLint warnings or errors
- ⚠️ Build (`pnpm build`): Failed due to network restrictions in sandbox environment (unrelated to security fixes)

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits:** Run `pnpm audit` regularly (e.g., weekly or before each release) to catch new vulnerabilities early.

2. **Automated Dependency Updates:** Consider using tools like Dependabot or Renovate to automatically create PRs for dependency updates.

3. **Monitor Peer Dependencies:** The audit revealed peer dependency warnings with @typescript-eslint/parser. While not security vulnerabilities, these should be addressed to ensure proper type checking:
   - `@typescript-eslint/parser@5.62.0` has unmet peer `eslint@"^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0"` (found 9.38.0)
   - `eslint-config-next` expects `@typescript-eslint/parser@^8.46.2` (found 5.62.0)

4. **Update Deprecated Packages:** The following packages are deprecated and should be updated in the future:
   - `react-tsparticles@2.12.2` → Use `@tsparticles/react` instead
   - `tsparticles-slim@2.12.0` → Use `@tsparticles/slim` instead
   - `tsparticles-engine@2.12.0` → Use `@tsparticles/engine` instead

## Conclusion

All identified security vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved. The codebase now passes security audits with no known vulnerabilities. Regular monitoring and updates are recommended to maintain security posture.
